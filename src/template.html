            <p>
              In 2024, Lexi, Parsley, and Molly opened "Green Haven," a
              farm-to-table restaurant inspired by their shared love of fresh,
              organic ingredients. Combining Lexi's culinary expertise,
              Parsley's knowledge of sustainable farming, and Molly's passion
              for community-driven dining experiences, they created a vibrant
              space that celebrates local produce. Their commitment to
              sustainability and innovation quickly made Green Haven a beloved
              spot in the heart of the city.
